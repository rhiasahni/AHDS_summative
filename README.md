# AHDS_summative

This project is a part of summative assessment for Applied Health Data Science course at University of Bristol. The purpose of this assessment is to demonstrate reproducible coding pratices in developing a code pipeline to access, clean, explore and visualize the selected dataset.

Dataset selected for this project is Blood Pressure (BPX_D) - https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2005-2006/BPX_D.htm. It is one of the data file from the NHANES survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm).
Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels. Accurate measurement of BP is essential for hypertension screening, as well as for disease management. High blood pressure (hypertension) can increase your risk of developing serious problems, such as heart attacks and strokes, if it's not treated. The aim of this project is to analyze this dataset to make suitable inference from the data.
